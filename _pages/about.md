I am a fourth year graduate student in the Social Psychology area. Born and raised in South Korea, I received her B.A. in Psychology and English Language & Literature and also her M.A. in Social Psychology from Yonsei University. 


Research Interests
------
I am mainly interested in how ecological threats shape people's time perspective and behavior, and how the environment creates individual differences in the way people define their sense of well-being. I spend my free time taking yoga lessons, traveling, and collecting funny cat memes.
