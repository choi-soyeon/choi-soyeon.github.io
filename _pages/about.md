I am currently a PhD student in the Psychology department at the University of Michigan.

You can download my CV [here](https://choi-soyeon.github.io/files/choi_cv.pdf).


Research Interests
------
My research focuses on the processes through which people perceive others and make decisions across different social and environmental contexts. I use both quantitative and qualitiative methods in addressing the questions.
